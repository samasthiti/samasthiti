A well-designed garden in a bungalow house can make the house look picturesque. Bungalows are built around Open spaces, courtyards, balconies, and terraces. It offers an eclectic canvas of greens, water bodies and seating. Bungalow designs on spacious plots usually have well-kept gardens with children's play areas and outdoor seating, making for beautiful bungalow home designs with greens. Stairs and water features with clean lines, neat hedges, and molded boundaries create a cohesive garden design. You can create a vertical garden in a limited space. The living room can be transformed into a sunny garden room due to the bungalow design's floor-to-ceiling windows visually connecting the rooms. The integration of plants into home gardens and living spaces is trending when designing bungalows with gardens and terraces.
