A good floor plan is essential when planning a small home because every square foot counts. Here are some elements to create a great little house floor plan.
High ceilings in small homes not only let in lots of natural light and make the area look larger, but they can also create attic space for extra space.
In addition to natural light, more windows bring in more natural light, minimizing the perceived barrier between the home and the outdoors.
Walls are your nemesis when designing a tiny house, so keep them to a minimum.
In a small house layout, the outside of the house is also a functional part of the living space, so make the most of the large wrap-around porch that connects the inside with the outside.
