Villas are very large houses and there is no legal definition of villa size between 8,000 and 9,000 square Feet. But the details of what qualify to vary by opinion and location. The mansion is also defined by luxury: tennis courts, wide-open foyers, grand staircases, and crystal chandeliers.

The idea of ​​a villa usually involves many aspects associated with luxury and high social status. In this sense, most villas usually have a large number of rooms, a garden, a large area for parking vehicles, and a swimming pool. , and many associated elements (such as sophisticated security systems and leisure areas). For a villa, it should be located in an enclave with special charm (for example, close to the ocean, with mountain views, or other distinguishing features), far from crowded urban spaces. This type of housing is affordable only to a minority of the population with above-average economic status.
