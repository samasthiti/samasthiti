Front elevation of the house, the most important part of the house, holds great importance in the architecture of a house, making the building more appealing visually. A well planned building elevation design provides the proper sunlight, avoids the excessive noises, better air circulation and maintaining the building temperature.

Therefore elevation designs require more study and understanding of components to make them look as one and whole instead of parts
