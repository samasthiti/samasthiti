5000 sq ft - 6000 sq ft construction projects are the general home construction projects in India.

5000 sq ft - 6000 sq ft construction cost in Indore is generally between Rs 1300 sq ft to Rs 1700 sq ft and it can vary according to your needs and requirements.

You can start your project with two methods 

<ol>
<li>With material contract (W.M.C)</li>
<li>Labor contract</li>
</ol>

W.M.C contract will make your work hassle free, all the project management responsibility will be of your contractor part and delivering your project on time with negligible errors will be the contractor part. Choose your contractor wisely who can analyze your problem and solve it in an easier manner. Make sure your paperwork is proper with your contractor. All things are pre planned properly before starting the project.

If you are free for 5-6 months then you can go with a labor contract just to make sure all your blueprints are correct and get cross verified with your engineer, architect and interior designer. 
Hire the engineer from time to time checking if all the work is going proper or not for the smoother running of the project with fewer errors (errors can increase your budget).
