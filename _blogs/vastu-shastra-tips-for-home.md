Let's start with the entrance of a house, which also acts as the doorway not just for people and their beloved pets but also for the positive energy. The main door should face the north direction, east direction, or in the north-east direction. It must be constructed in a way to ensure that when you step out, you face the North direction, east direction, or northeast direction.

Apart from direction, the main entrance should be well lit. Black color should be avoided on the main entrance door. There should not be a washroom close to the main entryway. The main entrance door should open in a clockwise direction.

Ideally, the kitchen should be built in the southeast direction of the house.

To brighten this region of the house, pick tones of yellow, light pink, peach, or brown. Avoiding hues of black or red would be beneficial.

Because the food we eat provides us with vitality, it must be cooked in a happy atmosphere. Hence, the cook must face East while cooking to ensure good health.
