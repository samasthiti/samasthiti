Vaastu Purusha is the god of construction of buildings and temples. Vaastu shastra is known as the science of architecture. Vaastu Purusha was the creation of Lord Brahma. Lord Brahma decided to create a man for earth. But the man was no ordinary but a man with enormous power to grow. As time passes the man becomes so enormous that his shadow has cast an eclipse on the earth. A lord brahma realizes his creation is starting to trouble him and gathers gods of eight directions. The gods of eight directions grabbed Vaastu purusha and pinned his head in the North East and legs in the South West direction. Lord Brahma in the center, told Vaastu purusha – “It is not your fault that you become a problem to earth. From now on I will make you immortal and every mortal whoever builds any structure on earth will worship you first”. Hence as per Vaastu shastra if any building is constructed as per Vaastu Purusha Mandala then prosperity prevails in the building and inhabitants are always happy, healthy, wealthy and satisfied.
