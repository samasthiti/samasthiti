Pre-Engineered Building services are the building components which are manufactured at a factory and assembled on site. Usually, PEBs are steel structures and can be an alternative to conventional structural steel buildings. PEB structural components are fabricated at the factory to exact size, transported to site and assembled at site, usually with bolted connections. This type of Structural Concept is generally used to build Industrial, Small Manufacturing Buildings, Small Retail, Commercial Office Buildings, Warehouses and Storage Units. It consists of light gauge metal standing seam roof panels on steel purlins spanning between rigid frames with light gauge metal wall cladding. They drastically reduce construction time. Maintenance is also extremely low. PEBs can be delivered to a site in just 5 to 8 weeks -conventional [steel structures](https://www.constrofacilitator.com/seismic-capability-of-steel-structures/) take as much as 20 to 25 weeks to complete. The unique techniques employed during fabrication help PEBs be up-to 30% lighter than regular steel products. No welding or fabrication is required at the construction site, resulting in greater speed and efficiency.
